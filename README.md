# Teemo-s-Bots
Working on creating Bots for everyday Tasks and games.

Im working on a Bot for the game Clash of Kings The West. 

The Bot should start with autofarming of ressources and end with more complexe features like automaticly collecting rewards, 
putting up a Peaceshield if getting attacked by a not authorized castle and much more. 

Im currently watching the pyautogui features as I think its the best one for making that Bot.
